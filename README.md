#Codeforces Contests Ladder
I recently came across the fact that codeforces doesn't provide the functionality to filter contests by division or type (or it does, but it's not sufficient). So, to find a contest of particular division or kind, I'd go through a lot of refreshes that wasn't just convienient. So, thought to make this simple app that contains the list of codeforces contests categorized by divisions, and other parameters (as Codeforces conducts many kinds of contests).


## Features to be implemented
* User able to input their username and and see which contests they have already attempted (useful for when someone's looking for contests to practice as a virtual contest).
* Add more categories.

## Setup
Clone the project into local. <br />
In the project directory, run:

#### `npm install`
This will install all the npm packages.

#### `npm start`
This will run the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Feel free to contribute to the project if you find it worth your time. Also, throw in your suggestions and feedbacks to make this project better. :)
